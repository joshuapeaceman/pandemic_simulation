GIT v1.0 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since previous release
------------------

** Documentation updates

  - Adds release note

** New features

  * New simulation parameters
	
	- Adds hospital/quarantine spots.
	
	 (These spots can be filled with sick/infected people. It removes them from the general population 
	 so they can't continue infecting healthy people.)
	
	- Adds counter_parameter when to send an infected person to the hospital/quarantine zone.
	
	  ((current_day - person.infection_start_day) == counter_parameter : send_person_to_quarantine_area()
	  
	- Adds population movement reduction parameters.
	
     (Reduce the movement of a person to a specific value after the infected population reaches a 
	 given percentage of the entire population.)
	 
	 
  * Animation features
  
	- Adds Plotly scatter plot animation to the program
	

  * PyQt multi-threading
  
	- Adds PyQt multi-threading to the program. 
	
	 (Starting a simulation won't block the program/GUI. We can now run multiple Simulations in parallel.)



** Bugfixes

  - Fixed killing off infected people mechanism. The simulation will now only try to kill a person once 
	and not on every day during the infected period. 



** Tweaks

  - Changed the geometry of the infectiou area around an infected person from a square to a circle
  
  - Removed recursion from the update_position() method inside the Person class. If the new position is outside 
    the main population area the method will invert the direktion of movement instead of recursively update the 
	positon again and again.
	
  - Set general simulation paramets inside the run_simulation() method of the ApplicatioController class. 
  
  
  
** Known bugs/issues

  - In some cases the position of a person will move outside the main population area. This is due to the 
    removed recursion in the update_position() method.
	
  - To change virus parameters the user has to click the Update Virus button and reselect the 
    virus from the drop down menu.
